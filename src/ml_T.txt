### Prototype Summary
The current workspace prototype is a fully functional implementation of a Carbon Footprint Calculator and Sustainability Dashboard. It integrates multiple components to provide a seamless experience for users to monitor, analyze, and manage their carbon emissions. Below is a detailed breakdown of the prototype:

1. **Frontend Components:**
   - **Dashboard (`src/scenes/dashboard/dashboard.tsx`):** Provides an overview of emissions data, including KPIs, trends, and recent activities. It uses `chart.js` for visualizations like doughnut and line charts.
   - **Emission Tracker (`src/scenes/emission_tracker.tsx`):** Tracks real-time and historical emissions data using `@nivo/line` for visualizations.
   - **Calculator (`src/scenes/calculator.tsx`):** Allows users to calculate emissions across Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 categories. It includes detailed breakdowns and supports exporting reports.
   - **Analytics (`src/scenes/analytics.tsx`):** Offers advanced visualizations like Sankey diagrams and sensitivity analysis using `@nivo/sankey` and `@mui/material`.
   - **Global Components (`src/scenes/global/topbar.tsx`, `src/scenes/global/sidebar.tsx`):** Provide navigation and layout structure for the application.
   - **Header Component (`src/components/header.tsx`):** A reusable component for displaying titles and subtitles.

2. **Backend Logic:**
   - **State Management (`src/stores/emissionsStore.ts`):** Manages emissions data, including scenarios and manual overrides, using `zustand`.
   - **Machine Learning Utilities (`src/utils/mlAnalytics.ts`):** Implements predictive analytics (e.g., linear regression for future emissions) and clustering (e.g., K-Means for grouping emissions data).

3. **Data Integration:**
   - **Data Sources (`src/data`):** Includes datasets like `ZA_2023_monthly.json` and `BW_2023_monthly.json` for emissions data.
   - **Real-Time Updates:** The `Emission Tracker` dynamically updates based on selected datasets.

4. **System Architecture:**
   - **Configuration Files (`vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.js`):** Define the build process, TypeScript settings, and Tailwind CSS customization.
   - **Index File (`index.html`):** Serves as the entry point for the application.

5. **Styling:**
   - **Global Styles (`src/index.css`):** Implements a consistent dark theme using Tailwind CSS.

6. **Development Tools:**
   - **Linting (`eslint.config.js`):** Ensures code quality and consistency.
   - **Package Management (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`):** Manages dependencies like `@nivo`, `react`, and `@mui`.
